# During the Hackathon

* Get free food and stuff
* Meet new people
* Attend the events and talks
* Evaluate vendor tech
* Think about your project and how many categories you can attempt

# Picking a Project

* Play to your strengths
* Have a neat idea that's easy to implement
* Be able to sell it; emphasize on the novelty
* Be novel to a layman, not necessarily to you
* Use sponsored vendor tech
* Pay no mind to what others are doing; people lie and cheat

# Preparation

* Have a team that you've worked well with before.
    * Know each other's strengths and weaknesses
    * Like them enough that you won't be screaming at them at 4 am
* Have a breadth of tech knowledge to be flexible
* Be able to stay up all night

# Pre-Reqs

1. Install the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up) for Win64
3. You can install git through the Heroku installer, if you didn't, [install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
4. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) and a [Heroku account](https://heroku.com); we'll be using their pepertually free plans

# Setup

First, let's create a directory and navigate to it. Get into command prompt and issue these commands:

    $ git init
    $ npm init # press enter for everything; the defaults are fine
    $ npm install --save express ejs

Now, we need to log into Heroku. Be warned that the first time you do it, it may take some time as it will update itself and you need to issue this command in either command prompt or PowerShell (not Git Bash):

    $ heroku login

# Coding!!!

Check the branches for steps!
